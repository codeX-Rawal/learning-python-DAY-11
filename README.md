📚 Topic: Tuples & Sets in Python
🧠 What I Learned Today

On Day-11, I explored Tuples and Sets, two important data structures in Python that help manage data safely and efficiently.

📌 Concepts Covered
🔹 Tuples

What is a tuple?

Creating tuples

Indexing & slicing

Tuple immutability

Tuple methods (count(), index())

🔹 Sets

What is a set?

Creating sets

Unique elements concept

Set methods:

add()

remove()

discard()

Set operations:

Union (|)

Intersection (&)

Difference (-)

🧪 Practice Examples

Store fixed data using tuples

Remove duplicate values using sets

Perform union & intersection

Compare list vs tuple vs set behavior
